                    Imagine if someone placed a key-logging tool in your personal computer and became privy to your passwords to social media, finances, school, or your organization. It would not take a lot of effort for this individual to ruin your life. There have been various solutions given to decrease your attack surface and mitigate the risks of cyberattacks. These can also be used on a small scale to protect yourself as an individual from such infiltrations.
                    You also need to authenticate the external collaborators. There are inevitable risks that come with sharing data to the external suppliers, clients, and partners that are essential in business. In this case, you need to know how long the data is being shared and apply controls to supervise the sharing permissions that can be stopped when required. If not for anything else, it would give you peace of mind to know that the information is safely being handled.
                    The future of cybersecurity lies in setting up frameworks, as individuals and as corporations, to filter the access to information and sharing networks.
